# VRoom VRoom Taco

Live out your wildest dreams of owning a taco truck in this VR game! Customers will drive up to your window and order either tacos or nachos. Use the ingredients to correctly fulfill these orders. But watch out, your truck is falling apart at the seams! Speed bumps cause ingredients and tools to shift around, the queso machine handle falls off, and a fire extinguisher must be used to put out sudden bursts of flame. Will you succeed?

This game is compatible with the Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest, and requires Oculus Touch controllers.
